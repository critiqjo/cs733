# CS 733: Engineering a Cloud

This repo contains assignments/projects done as part of the course CS 733.
A brief description of each of them are given below.

### Assignment 1: Versioned File Store

A simple in-memory file (key-value) store with support for these operations:
`read`, `write`, `delete`, and `cas` (compare and swap). More details can be
found in the [project directory](./assignment1).

### Assignment 2: Raft Implementation

A basic implementation of Raft protocol with the communication layer and state
machine layer abstracted out. More on design can be found in the [project
README](./assignment2/README.md).

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/critiqjo/cs733/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/critiqjo/cs733?branch=master)

A simple distributed application on top of Raft layer. More details in the
[project directory](./assignment3).

### Assignment 4=3+1: Distributed Versioned File Store

More details in the [project directory](./assignment4). Incomplete, and not
neatly done due to time constraints!
